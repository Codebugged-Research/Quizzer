                By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically
                apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
                carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or
                modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any
                way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of
                the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into
                other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself,
                and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
                intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to
                Codebugged AI.

              <p>
                Codebugged AI is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful
                and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right
                to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
                time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or
                its services without making it very clear to you exactly what
                you’re paying for.

                The Quiz Adda app stores and processes personal data that you
                have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s your
                responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.
                We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your
                phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions
                and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
                device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
                malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                security features and it could mean that the Quiz Adda app won’t
                work properly or at all.

                You should be aware that there are certain things that
                Codebugged AI will not take responsibility for. Certain
                functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by
                your mobile network provider, but Codebugged AI cannot take
                responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if
                you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your
                data allowance left.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the
                duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other
                third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
                region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are
                not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app,
                please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
                from the bill payer for using the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Along the same lines, Codebugged AI cannot always take
                responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make
                sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery
                and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Codebugged AI
                cannot accept responsibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                With respect to Codebugged AI’s responsibility for your use of
                the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in
                mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
                correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
                information to us so that we can make it available to you.
                Codebugged AI accepts no liability for any loss, direct or
                indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
                functionality of the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                currently available on Android – the requirements for system(and
                for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability
                of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the
                updates if you want to keep using the app. Codebugged AI does
                not promise that it will always update the app so that it is
                relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you
                have installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it
                at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless
                we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
                licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must
                stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
